## Gameplay
the game starts as soon as we click the "Game" button.
We move our space ship with left and right arrows on the keyboard and we can fire a bullet with key SPACE on the keyboard.
There can be only three bullets visible on the screen at the same time.
The fleet of aliens is moving sideways and down, approaching our space ship. When we manage to defeat the whole fleet of aliens, a new, faster fleet will appear. At that point our game level will increase by 1.

## End of the Game
We loose one life every time an alien crushes against our space ship or an alien reaches the bottom of the screen.
The game ends when we loose all three lives.
If the player sets a new game record, the highest game score will be updated.
